//struct of map 
//struct of player or have everything in one struct.
//we basically need *mlx
//*mlx_win
//*player - for connecting with img
//*wall -same
//size_t of position of player in x and y 
//**matrix of game to save map inside of our game
//we would also need height, length of the map. 
//and i think we woulld have to use flood_fill function to check if the map is valid to play and the player is not stuck. lets see how we are handeling this
